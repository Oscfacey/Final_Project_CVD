# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals based on various health and lifestyle factors. Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and this project aims to develop a machine learning model to assist in early detection and risk assessment.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: We employ a range of machine learning algorithms to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease accurately.

## Core Functionalities

- **Data Analysis**: We conduct thorough data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, identify correlations, and select relevant features for modeling.

- **Model Development**: We design, train, and evaluate machine learning models to predict cardiovascular disease risk.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The project is primarily implemented in Python, a versatile and powerful programming language.

- **Machine Learning Libraries**: We utilize libraries such as Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow for model development and evaluation.
